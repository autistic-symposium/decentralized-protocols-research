## data availability layer

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* data availability is the proof that the underlying data behind a particular hash was actually published and can be verified.
* data availability on the ethereum network is one of the primary scaling bottlenecks.
* ethereum protocol-level changes such as sharding and eip-4488 (proto-sharding) are intended to increase da and reduce the cost of storing data on ethereum. the current leading design is **danksharding**, which should happen in several steos.
