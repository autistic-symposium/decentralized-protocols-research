### the knapsack problem

<br>

* in the knapsack problem, you need to pack a set of items, with given values and sizes (such as weights or volumes), into a container with a maximum capacity.
* if the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, you can't pack them all. 
in that case, the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container.

### mempool latency

* there is no single mempool

<br>

##### compute latency

* dedupe
* transaction validation
* chain state checks


<br>

##### transport latency

* peering distance
* link quality
* peering changes
* liveliness of peers

<br>


##### validation pipeline strategies

* validation shortcuts
* more chain state caching (rely on memory instead of disk)
* private networks, bdn
* optimized peering, peri(gee)
